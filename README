This library allows for defining class-level attributes whose values:
  * are inherited by subclasses,
  * can be overridden temporarily in threads without worrying about resetting to the original value,
  * are memory efficient: they are swept if set to nil.

Example usage:
  class Resource
    class_inheritable_attr_accessor :site
  end
  
  class AccountingResource < Resource
    self.site = "http://account.example.com"
  end
  
  class Balance < AccountingResource
  end
  
  # Child's value defaults to parent's
  AccountingResource.site   # => "http://account.example.com"
  Balance.site              # => "http://account.example.com"
  
  # Child can set its own value
  Balance.site = "http://balance.account.example.com"
  AccountingResource.site   # => "http://account.example.com"
  Balance.site              # => "http://balance.account.example.com"
